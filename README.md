# Projects-towards-to-Data-Science

As I go deeper into the field of data science, this is where I'll keep track of my progress and the great extensions I come up with. It all starts with some cool projects based on real programming challenges, mostly part from HarvardX's Programming with Python program. It's like my coding diary, showcasing my modest victories and new skills as I go. Every project here is a new learning experience, with challenging puzzles solved one line of code at a time. So, here's to taking on additional challenges, learning the ropes, and coming one step closer to taking over the world of data science!
