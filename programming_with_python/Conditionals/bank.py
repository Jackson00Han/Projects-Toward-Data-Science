"""In season 7, episode 24 of Seinfeld, Kramer visits a bank that promises to give $100 to anyone who isn’t greeted with a “hello.” Kramer is instead greeted with a “hey,” which he insists isn’t a “hello,” and so he asks for $100. The bank’s manager proposes a compromise: “You got a greeting that starts with an ‘h,’ how does $20 sound?” Kramer accepts.

In a file called bank.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively."""

def main():
    # prompt the user the question
    question = input("What is the Answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything? ")

    # case-insensitively, whitespace-insensitively
    question = question.lower().strip()

    match question:
        case "42" | "forty-two" | "forty two":
            print("Yes")
        case _:
            print("No")
